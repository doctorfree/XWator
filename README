XWator was originally developed in 1990 by myself (Ronald Record) and Brian Chapman. It is an X11 client simulating evolving sharks and fish populations (predator/prey) dynamics.

Description
    Xwator is a simulation of sharks and fish with the fish "swimming" around and the sharks "eating" the fish. We added some rules to simulate evolution amongst both the sharks and the fish. 

Build
    To build with the Imakefile, first type "xmkmf" or "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config" if your system doesn't have xmkmf. Then just type "make" and the xwator binary will be built.

    The manual pages can be formatted by typing "nroff -man xwator.man > xwator.1" 

Install
    To install xwator, simply run "make install ; make install.man" as root. 

Usage

    xwator [-CEPe] [-R res] [-w width] [-h height]
    	[-M SHARK_MUTATE] [-S SHARK_SPAWN] [-T SHARK_STARVE]
    	[-m FISH_MUTATE] [-s FISH_SPAWN] [-t FISH_CRUSH]
    	Where :
    	'-C' indicates display population curves
    	'-E' indicates use full screen
    	'-P' indicates suppress population return maps
    	'-c' indicates continue computing
    	'-e' indicates erase screen every PPL generations
    	Defaults :
    	width=100 height=80
    	SHARK_SPAWN=10 SHARK_MUTATE=400 SHARK_STARVE=2
    	FISH_SPAWN=7 FISH_MUTATE=400 FISH_CRUSH=500

Safety
    I have used these for years without harm. 

Work Planned
    None
